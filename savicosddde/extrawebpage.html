    <h1>what is web development</h1>
    <p>
        Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications for the internet. It encompasses a range of activities, including web design, front-end development (client-side), back-end development (server-side), and database management. Web developers use various programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and others, to build interactive and dynamic websites that offer seamless user experiences.

Front-end developers focus on designing the user interface and implementing functionalities that users directly interact with. Back-end developers work on the server-side, handling data storage, processing, and ensuring smooth communication between the server and the client. They often work in tandem to create fully functional and visually appealing websites.

Web development has become critical for businesses and individuals alike, enabling online presence, e-commerce, information dissemination, and communication. With constant advancements in technology, web development continues to evolve, offering innovative solutions and shaping the digital landscape we experience daily.
