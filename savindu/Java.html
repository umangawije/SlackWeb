<h1>Paths to Boost Your Carrier as a Java Developer</h1>
<p>Java is a very old language. But, unlike C/C++, Pascal, Fortran etc., <br>
    it is still very much hot and in-demand with thousands of jobs in the<br>
    field of software development. However, many would fall in a trap of<br>
    being in a comfort zone maintaining very old Java applications with<br>
    technologies like EJB, SOAP WebServices, Struts or just core Java<br>
    based applications. Or, they spend time just maintain existing apps<br>
     with very little code, technology or architecture changes. Hence,<br> 
     when they know they will have to search for a new job, they suddenly<br> 
     wake up and get panicked about being irrelevant in today's market. It<br>
     is a very harsh reality that nobody would land a job to a Java developer <br>
     who is not well-versed with current technology trends. When people are <br>
     in such comfort zones, forget about preparing for the things that is in<br>
     demand, they do not even bother to visit LinkedIn! I have seen many such<br>
     cases in past several years. You should be proud on yourself if you are<br>
     reading this far, which shows you are really serious about learning.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-steps-i-would-take-boost-my-career-being-java-developer-pandit/">Continue reading.</a>
